      "short": "I'm a Systems Engineering student and a nerd who loves solving problems. I found in software my holy grail for doing it. I'm very good at automating tasks that used to take countless hours and entire teams, doing it scalably, efficiently and securely, driven by my passion for competitive programming and cybersecurity. Above all, I'm curious and love a good challenge.",
      "background": {
        "title": "Background",
        "text": "I've been programming seriously since 2022, when I placed 6th in my first ICPC tournament. A 2024 winter training camp was a turning point that transformed how I approach technical challenges.\n\nMy projects range from NASA Space Apps prediction algorithms to production systems with RAG architectures."
      },
      "approach": {
        "title": "Approach",
        "text": "I'm very pragmatic. Competitive programming trained me to always analyze the time and space complexity of my projects, but the multiple hackathons I competed in taught me to build and validate MVPs fast, without losing sight of the architecture and distributed systems design that engineering gave me."
