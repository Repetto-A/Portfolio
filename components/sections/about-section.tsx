                  I'm a 23-year-old systems engineering student specializing in management systems, automation, and
                  AI/ML development. My work focuses on creating practical solutions that solve real-world business
                  challenges.

                From factory quoting systems to real estate management platforms, I enjoy building applications that not only optimize operations but also create smoother, more intuitive user experiences. Recently, I contributed to NASAâ€™s Space Apps Challenge with an AI-powered seismic detection solution, alongside developing automation tools for various industries.

                I believe technology should give people back their time. Every project begins with deeply understanding the core problem, then designing solutions that are scalable, maintainable, and user-focused.

                  My experience spans full-stack development, machine learning implementation, and system architecture.
                  I'm particularly interested in how AI and automation can transform traditional business processes and
                  create new opportunities for innovation.
